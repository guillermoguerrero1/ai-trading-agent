- Date range (UTC): **2025-01-01 09:46:00+00:00 → 2025-01-01 10:20:00+00:00**
- Outcomes: `{"stop": 70}`
## Feature Coverage
- risk: 70 non-null (100.0%)
- rr: 70 non-null (100.0%)
- atr14: 0 non-null (0.0%)
- body_pct: 0 non-null (0.0%)
- upper_wick_pct: 0 non-null (0.0%)
- lower_wick_pct: 0 non-null (0.0%)
- htf_trend: 0 non-null (0.0%)
- in_session: 70 non-null (100.0%)

## Distributions (quantiles)
- risk: {"0.01": 2.0, "0.25": 2.0, "0.5": 2.0, "0.75": 2.0, "0.99": 2.0}
- rr: {"0.01": 2.0, "0.25": 2.0, "0.5": 2.0, "0.75": 2.0, "0.99": 2.0}
- atr14: n/a

## Checks
- ✅ **PASS** — All trades are NQ-only.
- ✅ **PASS** — Date range: 2025-01-01 09:46:00+00:00 → 2025-01-01 10:20:00+00:00 (UTC)
- ⚠️ **WARN** — Outcome skewed (win rate ≈ 0.0%). Consider adding more trades.
- ✅ **PASS** — Core features present (risk, rr).
- ⚠️ **WARN** — Low coverage on price-action/context features: atr14, body_pct, upper_wick_pct, lower_wick_pct, htf_trend.
- ⚠️ **WARN** — Found 70 potential duplicate rows (by ['symbol', 'side', 'entry_price', 'created_at']).

## Suggestions
- Increase dataset to 200–500 trades for more stable training.
- Improve outcome balance (add more sessions or adjust backfill parameters).
- Enhance feature coverage for atr14 (compute at backfill/order time).
- Enhance feature coverage for body_pct (compute at backfill/order time).
- Enhance feature coverage for upper_wick_pct (compute at backfill/order time).
- Enhance feature coverage for lower_wick_pct (compute at backfill/order time).
- Enhance feature coverage for htf_trend (compute at backfill/order time).
